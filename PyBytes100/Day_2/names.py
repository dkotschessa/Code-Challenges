"""
avatar Bite 5. Parse a list of names â˜†
In this bite you will work with a list of names.

First you will write a function to take out duplicates
 and title case them.

Then you will sort the list in alphabetical descending 
order by surname and lastly determine what the shortest
 first name is. For this exercise you can assume there is 
 always one name and one surname.

With some handy Python builtins you can write this in a pretty
 concise way. Get it sorted :)
