"""
In this Bite we'll get you to take user input using the input 
builtin and see if it matches items within a list.

In the while loop ask the user to enter a color and capture that input.

Check to see whether they've entered 'quit'. If so, print bye and exit 
(break) the loop, effectively ending the function.

If not, check to see whether the color (input) is in the VALID_COLORS
 color list. If it is, then print the color in lower case. If not, print 
 Not a valid color and continue the loop.

As you want to ask the user over and over again till they quit, you can
 use an infinite while loop. We already provided that in the template code,
  just code inside that loop.
